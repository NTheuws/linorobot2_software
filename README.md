# linorobot2
linorobot2 is a ROS2 port of the [linorobot](https://github.com/linorobot/linorobot) package. The goal of the Linorobot2 is to provide a starting point for an autonomously driving DIY (Do It Yourself) robot, which is made using accessible parts. So if you're planning to build your own custom ROS2 robot, then this package is for you. 

This project contains all things needed, from the hardware component list to how to get the robot set-up and running. Eventually you'll be able to make the robot drive around on it's own, set start/end points and have it automatically avoid obstacles on its path.

This project contains 2 repositories, one which has all the [software](https://github.com/NTheuws/linorobot2_software) and the other with the [hardware](https://github.com/NTheuws/linorobot2_hardware).

### Getting started with your own Linorobot
An in-depth tutorial on all the steps required from scratch until the final product is available to make the process of creating your own Linorobot2 as easy as possible. To get started go to [the wiki](https://github.com/NTheuws/linorobot2_software/wiki/Required-hardware). From there on, you can take it step by step with the links provided in the bottom of each page. A table of contents will also be shown on the right in case you'd like to look around or get to where you left off faster.
